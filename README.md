# A multi-view pig 2D-3D pose dataset (M3DPigset)
  We provide a multi-view 2D-3D pig pose dataset that can be used for pig behavior analysis. This dataset was captured in various poses in natural pigpen settings using multiple low frame rate cameras. It not only enriches the available data pool but also serves as a benchmark for evaluating and advancing pig-specific 3D pose estimation techniques. The dataset contains various movements like running, walking and jumping which helps to analyze the behavior of pigs in 3D.
